# es.coresystem.Settings2

Settings2 is the succesor of es.post0.Settigs (Source code not avaiable) for the fonsOS 3 operative system.
It is based in the same css and html as Settings, but it uses NeutralinoJS ins stead of ElectronJS because it is much faster and since fonsOS y is mostly based in JS apps, running multiple chromium instances is a mess.

fonsOS 2 dont use this app, it uses [Gnome Settings](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center)

This app is incomplete and mostly all features are not working.

Settings2 includes new ways to interact with the fonsOS system, like an updater for the new GeminiSystem, the management of SOGUESTs and OSGUESTs, CerebroCore and UnifiedUI tweaks.
